                                A Spaniard has won a legal battle to include in her work record the time she spent attending a social program for women that was created in the Franco era, enabling her to qualify for early retirement after a ruling based on gender equality.<br>

The woman had found herself seven days short of the minimum time spent working to qualify for early retirement because she was unable to include the period spent on the program created in 1937 to help women learn social and labor skills.<br>

Her request to retire early was turned down by the National Social Security Institute and the decision was upheld by Catalonia's top regional court.<br>

                                Young Men Embrace Gender Equality, but They Still Don’t Vacuum       <br>                                                                        
								Young people today have become much more open-minded about gender roles —<br>
								it shows up in their attitudes about pronouns, politics and sports. But in one area, change has been minimal. They are holding on to traditional views about who does what at home.

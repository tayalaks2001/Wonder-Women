					Wonder Women is not just the name of a company, it is the symbol of hope for women who wonder why are they still paid less than their male counterparts, 
					women who wonder why they still have to face work-place discrimination and why they have to fight for every oppprtunity in life. Our aim to promote gender 
					equality made us think about how we as a group of Computer Science undergraduates could help the women of the 21st Century create wonders by simply giving
					them a platform to come together and pool their resources even for the most basic of their necessities and start a revolution which provides more jobs and
					makes women more aware about what's going on in the world around them.'

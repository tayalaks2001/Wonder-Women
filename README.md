# Wonder-Women
Weâ€™re choosing the theme of gender equality, and we plan to build a web application aiming to reduce work-place discrimination against women and also help with life in general. We plan to include a host of features such as:
1. Blog section that has articles pertaining to women-specific issues, with a moderated discussion board for people to discuss these issues with like minded individuals
2. Complaint centre linked to the MOM that delivers complaints submitted by women to the MOM database directly
3. Platform for women to pool in resources for women to buy women-specific amenities at reduced prices
